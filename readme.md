# Translate My Code v0.1

Did you know that EcmaScript(JavaScript and ActionScript) languages support unicode variable, function and class names? Now nothing stops from writing all your variables names in Korean, function names in Chinese and Class names in Russians.

But what if you already have a huge project that you want to convert to different language?
Fear not my friend, as this Python script will let you translate your code using Google Translate into any language or even multiple languages at once!

## Setup

Requires Python 3

Required modules:

* futures 2.1.6
* goslate 1.1.2
* regex 2014.02.19

Quick Setup
1. Get Python 3
2. (Optionally) Install `virtualenv` - http://www.virtualenv.org/
3. Install all required modules from `requirements.txt` using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
`py -3 translatemycode.py fileWithCode.as otherFileWithCode.js -l language`
Don't specify `-l` to use random language for each word.

## Extending script

Pull requests are welcomed, as long as variable names are not in English.
